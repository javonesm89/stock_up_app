            <p>To get you right into action we had a special person, Elon Musk, gift you $<%= @investor.account_balance %>. - We don't know why he did this.</p>
            <p>I'd recommend first to check out some stocks and get familiar with them.</p>
            <p>Notice the stock ticker (i.e, NIKE = NKE) as well as the stock price! If you can buy a share or 2, great.</p>
            <p>Remember to do some outside research and see if this is a stock YOU want to own.</p>

            <p>If you know what stocks you want then I'd recommend heading over to your account and placing an order. Each order will contain 1 stock but you can order any number of shares for that stock as long as it fits your budget.</p>

            <p>Your account balance will reflect any orders (whether a sell or buy) and adjust accordingly.</p>
